#Gender_parity_data_transformations
This repository contains data transformation scripts and resources for analyzing gender parity data. The project focuses on preparing datasets, cleaning, and performing necessary transformations to make the data suitable for further analysis and insights into gender equality metrics across various sectors.

Project Overview
The Gender_parity_data_transformations repository provides the tools and code to process and transform raw gender parity data. The aim is to facilitate accurate reporting and decision-making around gender equality by creating clean, structured datasets.

Features
Data cleaning and transformation scripts
Data aggregation for gender parity analysis
Easy-to-use functions for data preprocessing
Support for multiple data formats (e.g., CSV, Excel)
Code and methods for visualizing gender parity trends
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib (for visualization)
other relevant libraries (see requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Gender_parity_data_transformations.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd Gender_parity_data_transformations
Install the required dependencies:

nginx
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Load the data into your script using the provided transformation functions:

python
Copy
import pandas as pd
from transformations import gender_parity_cleaning

data = pd.read_csv('data/gender_parity_raw.csv')
cleaned_data = gender_parity_cleaning(data)
Run the analysis and generate reports/visualizations:

python
Copy
from analysis import gender_parity_analysis

results = gender_parity_analysis(cleaned_data)
Example Transformations
Here are a few examples of data transformation scripts available in this repository:

gender_parity_cleaning.py: Handles missing data, standardizes formats, and filters relevant columns.
gender_parity_visualization.py: Creates bar charts and line graphs to visualize gender parity trends.
